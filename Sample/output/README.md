## Experimental Graphs
### Kmeans
##### Scatter Plot
-   This graph shows accuracy fraction for each grouping of 5 words(sorted by confidence values) on the y-axis vs the confidence values in the x-axis.
     -  Image of accuracy vs confidence of 150+ words with grouping of 5 words

-   This graph shows for each confidence bin on the x-axis what is the percentage contribution for accuracy =1 for that bin.
-   The markings above each bar indicates the following:
    - Numerator: The counts of confidence values with accuracy =1 
    - Denominator: Total points for that confidence bin

-   Image 1 : With around 34 points
